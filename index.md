## About

I'm a Software Engineer at [Databricks](https://databricks.com/). Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer for [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu/). I graduated from [Helwan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helwan_University) with a degree in Accounting, but I have always been passionate about computers. I started self-studying computer science and programming in 2014, made my first contribution to an open source project in 2015, and joined the CS50 team at Harvard in 2017.


## Experience

**Harvard University** - Software Engineer 2017–2021<br>
Helped teach and support 3+ intro-level CS and programming classes, including [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), Harvard’s largest CS class with 700+ students on campus and [1M+ registrants online](https://cs50.edx.org/). Built and maintained tools used by tens of teachers, hundreds of students on campus, and tens of thousands of students online. Mentored groups of students while they worked on dev projects.Helped teach and support 3+ intro-level CS and programming classes, including CS50, Harvard’s largest CS class with 700+ students on campus and 1M+ registrants online.

**HST** - Software Engineer 2015–2016<br>
Built websites for different company product lines. Worked with a team of 3 developers on Android apps that integrated with the company’s hardware products (e.g., security cameras, electronic gates, etc) and APIs. Implemented custom solutions for other companies and organizations.


## Projects

**CS50 IDE** - A cloud-based IDE based on AWS Cloud9<br>
Designed and built the infrastructure backend and the orchestration of compute and storage on top of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/), and other tools and services, optimizing for cost and resources and speeding up the IDE’s loading time by at least 6x. Built a set of JavaScript plugins that simplify and customize the look and feel of the IDE, making it more accessible to students with no prior programming experience.

**publish50** - An Electron app for facilitating video production workflows<br>
Designed and built an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app with a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend that helped CS50's production team by streamlining the transcoding of terabytes of videos, using [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), and publishing the generated assets to YouTube and the course's CDN, backed by [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), speeding up the production time of a single video by at least 5x.

**Other work**<br>
Helped develop, dockerize, and configure CI/CD pipelines for many teacher- and student-facing apps (e.g., auto-testing/grading, submission tools, etc) to different services (e.g., [EB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/), [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), etc). Supported teachers and students with different technical issues.
