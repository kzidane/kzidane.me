## About

I'm a Software Engineer at [Databricks](https://databricks.com/). Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer for [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu/). I graduated from [Helwan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helwan_University) with a degree in Accounting, but I have always been passionate about computers. I started self-studying computer science and programming in 2014, made my first contribution to an open source project in 2015, and joined the CS50 team at Harvard in 2017.


## Experience

**Harvard University** / Software Engineer 2017–2021<br>
I helped teach and support 3+ introductory-level CS and programming classes, including [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), Harvard’s largest CS class with 700+ students on campus and 1M+ registrants [online](https://cs50.edx.org/), where I built and maintained tools used by hundreds of students on campus and tens of thousands of students online, mentored 2+ undergrads as they worked on dev projects over the summer, and mentored groups of students as they worked on their final projects during the semester.


**HST** / Software Engineer 2015–2016<br>
Developed websites for different company product lines and worked with a team of 3 developers on Android apps that integrated with the company’s hardware products (e.g., security cameras, electronic gates, etc) and APIs and implemented custom solutions for other companies and organizations.


## Projects

**CS50 IDE** / A cloud-based IDE based on AWS Cloud9<br>
Designed and built the infrastructure backend and the orchestration of compute and storage on top of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/), and other tools and services, optimizing for cost and resources and speeding up the IDE’s loading time by at least 6x. Developed a set of JavaScript plugins that simplify and customize the look and feel of the IDE, making it more accessible to students with no prior programming experience.

**publish50** / An electron app for facilitating video production workflows<br>
Designed and built an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app with a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend that helps CS50's production team by streamlining the transcoding of terabytes of videos, using [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), and publishing the generated assets to YouTube and the course's CDN, backed by [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), speeding up the production time of a single video by at least 5x.

**debug50** / A wrapper script/plugin around Cloud9’s debugger<br>
Contributed improvements and bug fixes to the underlying gdb interface and added support for debugging Python 3 scripts by integrating i[kp3db](https://github.com/cs50/ikp3db/).

**Other work**<br>
Helped develop, dockerize, and configure CI/CD pipelines for many teacher- and student-facing apps (e.g., auto-testing/grading, submission tools, etc) to different services (e.g., [EB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/), [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), etc). Supported teachers and students with different technical issues.
