## Summary

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience at building large-scale distributed systems and developer tools. I'm currently at [Databricks](https://databricks.com/){:target="_blank"} working managed ETL orchestration systems. Previously, I built software tools and cloud infrastructure for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}, serving over 1M students and hudreds of teachers worldwide.

## Experience

**Databricks** - Sr. Software Engineer 2021–Present

I help develop Databricks Lakeflow [Jobs](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-engineering/lakeflow-jobs) and [Pipelines](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-engineering/spark-declarative-pipelines){:target="_blank"}, a fully managed orchestration system data processing, machine learning, and analytics pipelines. I helped build features such as [task values](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workflows/jobs/share-task-context.html){:target="_blank"}, [repair and rerun](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workflows/jobs/repair-job-failures.html){:target="_blank"}, [file arrival triggers](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/jobs/file-arrival-triggers){:target="_blank"}, and [job parameters](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/jobs/dynamic-value-references) among others. Recently I have been focusing on improving the reliability and scalability of Lakeflow Jobs and Pipelines.

**Harvard University** - Software Engineer 2017–2021<br>
Helped teach and support 3+ intro-level CS and programming classes, including [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Harvard’s largest CS class with 700+ students on campus and [1M+ registrants online](https://cs50.edx.org/){:target="_blank"}. Built and maintained tools used by hundreds of teachers, hundreds of students on campus, and tens of thousands of online learners. Mentored student dev teams.

## Projects

**CS50 IDE** - A cloud-based IDE based on AWS Cloud9<br>
Designed and built the infrastructure backend and the orchestration of compute and storage on top of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){:target="_blank"}, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/){:target="_blank"}, and other tools and services, optimizing for cost and resources and speeding up the IDE’s loading time by at least 6x. Built a set of JavaScript plugins that simplify and customize the look and feel of the IDE, making it more accessible to students with no prior programming experience.

**publish50** - An Electron app for facilitating video production workflows<br>
Designed and built an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/){:target="_blank"} app with a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/){:target="_blank"} frontend that helped CS50's production team by streamlining the transcoding of terabytes of videos, using [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/){:target="_blank"}, and publishing the generated assets to YouTube and the course's CDN, backed by [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/){:target="_blank"} and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/){:target="_blank"}, speeding up the production time of a video from a day+ to just a few hours.

**debug50** - A wrapper for the Cloud9 debugger<br>
Improved the underlying gdb interface and added support for debugging Python 3 programs by integrating [ikp3db](https://github.com/cs50/ikp3db/){:target="_blank"}.
